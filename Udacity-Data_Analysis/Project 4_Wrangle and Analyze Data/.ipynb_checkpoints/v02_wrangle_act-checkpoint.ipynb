    "\n",
    "Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, data was gathered from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. Data wrangling efforts was documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which was then showcased  through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that used for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because [\"they're good dogs Brent.\"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent). WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs [downloaded their Twitter archive](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive) and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.\n",

    "# B. Project Motivation\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "The goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",

    "\n",
    "This provided data set was extracted programmatically, but more processing (e.g., cleaning and tyding) is requried. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. As stated before more data processing is required to assess and clean these columns for later analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dog dictionary](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59e04ceb_dogtionary-combined/dogtionary-combined.png)\n",
    "*The Dogtionary explains the various stages of dog: doggo, pupper, puppo, and floof(er) (via the [#WeRateDogs book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/WeRateDogs-Most-Hilarious-Adorable-Youve/dp/1510717145))*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, \"anyone\" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. The Twitter's API was used to query this valuable data. \n",

    "**Please note that the Twitter API was NOT utilized for this project for data securty/privacy reasons. This data was provided for the scope of this project.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Predictions File\n",
    "\n",
    "One more cool thing: Every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive was processed through a [neural network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Ol7ZB0MmU) that can classify breeds of dogs* (provided by project). The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
    "\n",
    "![tweet image prediction](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59dd4d2c_screenshot-2017-10-10-18.43.41/screenshot-2017-10-10-18.43.41.png)\n",

    "So for the last row in that table:\n",

    "tweet_id is the last part of the tweet URL after \"status/\" → https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/889531135344209921\n",
    "* p1 is the algorithm's #1 prediction for the image in the tweet → **golden retriever**\n",
    "* p1_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #1 prediction → **95%**\n",
    "* p1_dog is whether or not the #1 prediction is a breed of dog → **TRUE**\n",
    "* p2 is the algorithm's second most likely prediction → **Labrador retriever**\n",
    "* p2_conf is how confident the algorithm is in its #2 prediction → **1%**\n",
    "* p2_dog is whether or not the #2 prediction is a breed of dog → **TRUE**\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the #1 prediction for the image in that tweet was spot on:\n",

    "*A golden retriever named Stuart*\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's all fun and good. But all of this additional data will need to be gathered, assessed, and cleaned--which is the scope of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only use original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "* Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of [tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html).\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This [unique rating system](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent) is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "* It is not required to gather tweets beyond August 1st, 2017 because it is out of scope. Image predictions cannot be gathered for new tweet data after this date because the source file for the image prediction is not provided--again out of scope for this project\n",
