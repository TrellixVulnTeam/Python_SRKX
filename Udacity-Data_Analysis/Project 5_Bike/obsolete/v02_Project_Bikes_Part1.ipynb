The multivariate exploration here showed that there indeed is a positive effect of increased quality grade on diamond price, but in the dataset, this is initially hidden by the fact that higher grades were more prevalent in smaller diamonds, which fetch lower prices overall. Controlling for the carat weight of a diamond shows the effect of the other C's of diamonds more clearly. This effect was clearest for the color and clarity variables, with less systematic trends for cut.\n",
